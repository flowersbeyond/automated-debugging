AIM:  tidy up defects4j repositories

$Defects4jDir = your defects4j root directory

1. download defects4j from: https://github.com/rjust/defects4j
2. follow the instructions at Readme.md, and set up defects4j repositories.
3. the directory should look like this:
defects4j
   |
   |--- project_repos:     The version control repositories of the provided projects.
   |
   |--- major:             The Major mutation framework.
   |
   |--- framework:         Libraries and executables of the database abstraction and
       |                   test execution framework.
       |
       |--- bin:           Command line interface to Defects4J.
       |
       |--- core:          The modules of the core framework.
       |
       |--- lib:           Libraries used in the core framework.
       |
       |--- util:          Util scripts used by Defects4J.
       |
       |--- projects:      Project-specific resource files.
       |
       |--- test:          Scripts to test the framework.

4. checkout repositories and generate difference summary files
    a. configure script generation project
        i. checkout project:defects4j-scriptgen(address??)
        ii. open it with eclipse.
        iii. configure directory constants in file "Constants.java" following the COMMENT code
    
    b. extract all versions of program repositories
        i. run "RepExtractor.java", this will generate a "checkout_all.sh" under "$Defects4jDir".
	ii. run "checkout_all.sh", this will extract all versions of defects4j programs under "$Defects4jDir/testprojects". The directory structure would look like this:

defects4j
    |
    |---testprojects
        |---Chart
            |---v1
                |---b:		the buggy version
                |---f:		the fixed version
            |---v2
            |---...
        |---Closure
        |---...
    
    c. generate difference summary files
        i. run "DiffGenerator1.java", this will generate a "gen_diff.sh" under "$Defects4jDir".
        ii. run "gen_diff.sh", this will generate a "classes_modified" file under the directory of each buggy version of each extracted program repository (for example: "$Defects4jDir/testprojects/Chart/v1/b/classes_modified")
        iii. run "DiffGenerator2.java", this will generate a "gen_diff_all.sh" under each extracted program repository root (for example:"$Defects4jDir/testprojects/Chart/gen_diff_all.sh")
        iv. run all "gen_diff_all.sh" under all 5 program repositories, this will generate a "classes_modified_summary" under each each extracted program repository root (for example: "$Defects4jDir/testprojects/Chart/classes_modified_summary")
        v. scan the 5 "classes_modified_summary" files and you can get a general idea of possible fix patterns".
